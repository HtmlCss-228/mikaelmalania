                Paris has changed a lot in the last few decades. Not so long ago, the tourist circuit was limited to a small number of famous locations and you’d find few locals who spoke more than a handful of phrases in English. These days, Paris is a more worldly, cosmopolitan place. However, the densely packed French capital still has its distinct way of doing things. Parisian culture places huge value on food, beauty and leisure, and many of the faux pas (at least in the eyes of Parisians) made by visitors occur when these sacred principles are infringed. From dining to (not) queuing, here’s your easy guide to navigating the City of Lights the Parisian way.
